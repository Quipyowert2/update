# Homebrew Cask for macOS
#
# Try to do the upgrade the ad hoc way.
#
# As of 2019-04-10, this way is the best known simple
# way to figure out which casks are outdated then upgrade
# each one, one by one, and continuing even if any cask fails.
#
# Note that we use the `--greedy` flag, which means we update
# an app even when brew knows that the app does auto-updates.
#
# Some typical examples of these are IntelliJ, WebStorm, RubyMine.
# We use the `--greedy` flag because we prefer doing all updates
# via brew rather than relying on each app's auto-update process.
