# Brew for macOS
#
# Caution: major macOS upgrades result in /usr/local ownership reverted
# to root:wheel. We have improved the situation already, but there's one
# last migration you need to do which requires writing permission of /usr/local.

#     sudo chown "$(whoami)" /usr/local
#     cd /usr/local
#     git fetch
#     git reset --hard origin/master
#     brew update --force

if command -v brew >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  if [[ `whoami` != "root" ]]; then
    brew update
    brew upgrade
