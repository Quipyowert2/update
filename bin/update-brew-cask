# Homebrew Cask for macOS

# We try to do the upgrade the official way.
#
# As of 2019-04-10, this way will stop as soon
# as any cask upgrade fails; this does not do any
# of the remaining casks are never upgraded.
#
# This is not ideal behavior because it means
# brew gets "stuck" forever on any broken cask.
#
# We have a workaround in the file:
# `update-brew-cask-outdated-greedy`.
#
# N.b. this script

if command -v brew >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  if [[ `whoami` != "root" ]]; then
    # We skip running `brew update` because it will have
    # just been run by the previous `update-brew` script,
    # and we prefer to save the time it takes to run it.
