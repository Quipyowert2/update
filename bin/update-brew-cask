# Homebrew Cask for macOS
#
# We try to do the upgrade the official way.
#
# As of 2019-04-10, this way will stop as soon
# as any cask upgrade fails; this does not do any
# of the remaining casks are never upgraded.
#
# This is not ideal behavior because it means
# brew gets "stuck" forever on any broken cask.
#
# We have a workaround in the file:
# `update-brew-cask-outdated-greedy`.
